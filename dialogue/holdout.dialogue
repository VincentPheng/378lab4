~ holdout

Tom: Shit! The door is stuck shut!
Jerry: Step aside kids, I'll blast it open by cranking it to 11!
Dexter: That won't work.
Jerry: Huh?
Dexter: The school uses reinforced steel doors. Doesn't matter how hard you blast it, if it isn't at least an IED, it's not breaking it down.
Tom: So this is where we die?
Dexter: No. These use electronic locks so I can hack them open but it'll take time.
Jerry: How long?
Dexter: 90 seconds.
Tom: Alright boys, grab what you can and holdout while Dexter does his magic.
Jerry: YEA LETS ROCK!
